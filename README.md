## Hi there 👋

My name is Benny 🎉 and I am a Computer Engineer 👨‍💻 by education, Software Developer by passion. 

I got into tech and science from an anime scene, where a computer engineer, was coding and repairing a time machine in C and some robotics back in 2018.


Yeah, you're right, I started with Python, not C 😅 on the SoloLearn app.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on integrating Python into robotics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java for app development
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ML projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with PyQt desktop designing
- 💬 Ask me about technology and scientists
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I commit with spaces... and got rejected by all the Ivies

💡 Currently, I'm always learning, always creating, always improving!
