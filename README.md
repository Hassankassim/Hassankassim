# Hi there 👋

My name is Benjamin 🎉 and I am a Computer Engineer 👨‍💻 by education, Software Developer by passion. 

I got into tech and science from an anime scene, where a computer engineer, was coding and repairing a time machine ⏳ in C and doing some robotics 🤖 back in 2018.

Looking forward to entering on the Startup Space.
